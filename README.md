# Introduction
Hello there, I’m [Paused](https://pausedweb.carrd.co)!

I’m interested in music, video games, anime, manga, coding & more.

I’m currently learning everything, I just know a bit of Python.

That's all for now. This GitHub page is mainly for future projects, hopefully I'll get some use out of it someday.
